# CS106B_CppAssm7
Have you ever wondered how MapQuest and Google Maps or those tiny little GPS units work their magic? Get ready to find out. In this final CS106B challenge, you will create the Pathfinder application, which (in addition to other useful functions) finds and displays the shortest path between two locations on a map. The Pathfinder assignment is designed to accomplish the following objectives: • To give you practice working with graphs and graph algorithms. • To offer you the chance to design and write a class of your own. • To let you practice using callback functions in an application.
